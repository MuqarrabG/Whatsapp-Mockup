# What Was The Plan For Sprint 1?

    - structure and design
    1. plan the structure of the database as a simple json file for now
        - the use of a json file will not be permenant
    2. create a react app as a tamplate for the project
    3. setup a dummy json server using the database structure json file
    4. design the structure of the application (the hierarchy of the pages)
    5. design the visual asthetics of the App
    6. create a series of blank component.js files to describe the structure and design of the application as a whole
        - points 4 and 5 must happen first
    7. write a sprint report.
