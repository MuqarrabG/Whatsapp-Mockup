# What Was The Plan For Sprint 2?

    1. Convert dummy server into express run server
    2. Begin developing the HTML and CSS of the following pages:
        - Inbox/Home screen
        - Send message screen
        * this will all be done in reference to our designs created using Figma from Sprint 1
    3. Introduce the router to the project, to route between the pages of the app.
