# What Was The Plan For Sprint 2?

    1. Convert dummy server into express run server
    2. Begin developing the HTML and CSS of the following pages:
        - Inbox/Home screen
        - Send message screen
        - Setting home screen 
        * this will all be done in reference to our designs created using Figma from Sprint 1
    3. Introduce the router to the project, to route between the pages of the app.
    4. Introduce Socket.IO to the project for instant communication aspect of the project.

# What Work Actually Happened

## {Muqarrab's} Progress
   * Used HTML & CSS to create the look of the home page of the web app in accordance with the figma designs.
      - This is a list of the components that make up the home page.
         - **Home Page**
            - **Sidebar**
               - **Topbar**
               - **Search Bar**
               - **Chat List**
            - **Messaging Panel** 
               - **Header**
               - **Chat Messages**
               - **Message Input**
   * some challenges were:
      - having the components always return a value (for example, a loading screen if the content was not ready yet.)
      - having a default value when the data is lacking (for example, a default profile picture if the user hasn't se one yet.)

## {Andrew's} Progress
   * Used express to begin making a proper backend server in place of the dummy one that we had from sprint 1
      - this is not finished, Put and Delete requests still need to be handled and the add reaction call needs discussion.
   * Added a calls.md file to the server folder so that the frontend developers can use the backend I have made easily.
