# What Was The Plan For Sprint 3?

1. Begin using websockets to send and receive messages.
2. Continue working on the express server:

- PUT and DELETE requests
- Expand reactions call to handle PUT, POST, DELETE, and GET for when a user may add or change a reaction.
- We had planned to integrate MongoDB but this may have to be pushed to Sprint 4

3. Front end should make calls to the axios server rather than hard coded into the front end.
4. A few visual changes we wish to change to the front end such as:

- Autoscroll to the bottom of the page (to show the latest message) cutting off the input field for a new message
